1. Base Class - Device:

- Base class named "Device".

- Included the following attributes:

    - "type" (String) - Represents the type of the device ("Smartphone," "Laptop," "Tablet").

    - "price" (double) - Represents the price of the device in USD.

    - "weight" (double) - Represents the weight of the device in grams.

- Implemented a parameterized constructor to initialize these attributes.

- Implemented getters and setters for all attributes.

2. Derived Classes:

    - Created three derived classes, each representing a specific type of device (like "Smartphone", "Laptop", "Tablet").

    - Each derived class inherits from the "Device" class and have additional attributes and methods 

3. Main Program:

    - In the main program, user enters the number of devices they want to create.

    - Generating random instances of the derived classes with different types and prices for the specified number of devices.

    - Calculating and display the following information:

        - The number of distinct device types created.

        - The total price of all devices.

        - The total weight of all devices.
